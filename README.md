# Simplified Unix-Like Utilities

## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of commonly used Unix-like utilities in C. Each utility replicates the functionality of corresponding Unix commands, offering valuable insights into system programming, file operations, and command-line interface design.

## Project - 1
Using the xv6 operating system
a. Analyzed the existing implementation of system calls that you plan to modify.
b. Wrote new system calls for fork tree, signals, waitpid, exit, priorty pipes.
c. Demonstrated their usage by adding a user program in xv6 that incorporates them.

## Project - 2 
In this project, you have to developed a series of simplified UNIX-like utilities. Some utilities are
mentioned here
a. ls - List directory contents
ls -l, ls -a, ls -s
b. cat - Concatenate and display file content
cat -u, cat -l
c. grep - Search for patterns in files
grep -i, grep -v
d. wc - Word, line, and character count
e. cp - Copy files
cp -r
f. mv - Move or rename files
mv -r
g. rm - Remove files or directories
rm -r
